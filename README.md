## System Architecture
<a g="system-architecture"></a>
The StudyNotion ed-tech platform consists of three main components: the front end, the
back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the
front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.

### Front-end 
<a h="front-end"></a>
The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user
interfaces, which are critical for providing an engaging learning experience to the students.
The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls

### Back-end 
<a i="bront-end"></a>
The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS,. The back end
provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as user
authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back end also handles the
logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.


### Database
<a j="database"></a>
The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that
provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of
unstructured and semi-structured data. The database stores the course content, user data, and other
relevant information related to the platform.

    3] ***For NodeMailer follow below steps ‚Äì***

    - By default, Gmail prevents bots from accessing emails hosted on Google servers. Gmail runs 
      several checks to ensure that every email account is accessed by a recognized user at a 
      recognized location.
    - Google requires your account to have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled to connect it to Nodemailer.
    - We‚Äôll also need to set up an app password. To do so, follow these steps:
      - Make sure you‚Äôre logged in to your Gmail account
      - Under How you sign in to Google, select 2-Step Verification
      - You‚Äôll be prompted to sign in to your email again
      - Scroll down to App passwords and click the arrow, >
      - In the Select app dropdown, select your app or enter a custom name, then do   the same 
        for the Select device dropdown
      - Click Generate, and a modal will pop up with your 16-digit app password.Copy it to 
        somewhere secure

     Now, Finally put your email in MAIL_USER & app password in MAIL_PASS in .env file. It is 
     necessary, unless you will not receive OTP on  your mail.



   4] ***For JWT_SECRET follow the below steps ‚Äì***
 
   - This is typically a secret key used for JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in your 
     application. 
   - You can generate a random string using a tool like crypto in Node.js. For example:
   ```bash
   const crypto = require('crypto');
   const jwtSecret = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
   console.log(jwtSecret);
   ```
   - Copy the generated string and paste it as the value for JWT_SECRET in your .env file.


   5] ***For Cloudinary follow the below steps ‚Äì***

     - Sign Up for Cloudinary: Go to the Cloudinary website (https://cloudinary.com) and sign up 
       for an account. You can choose the free plan to get started.
     - Access Dashboard: After signing up and logging in, you'll be redirected to your Cloudinary 
       dashboard.
     - Find Your Cloud Name: Your Cloudinary cloud name is displayed on the dashboard. It's 
       usually in the format [your_cloud_name]. Copy this value.
     - Generate API Key and API Secret: In the Cloudinary dashboard, navigate to the "Account 
       Details" or "Dashboard" section. Here, you'll find your API key and API secret. If you 
       don't see them, you may need to generate them. Look for an option like "API Credentials" 
       or "API Key & Secret". 
     - If you need to generate API key and secret, click on the appropriate button/link and 
       Cloudinary will provide you with the key and secret.   
     - If they are already provided, simply copy them.
     - Now that you have your Cloudinary ‚ÄúCLOUD_NAME‚Äù, ‚ÄúAPI_KEY‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAPI_SECRET‚Äù, you can set 
       them up in your .env file as described earlier.
       CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
       API_KEY=your_api_key
       API_SECRET=your_api_secret

   6] ***For Razorpay follow the below steps-***

     - Log in to your Dashboard with appropriate credentials.
     - Select the mode (Test or Live) for which you want to generate the API key.
     - Select the `test mode` for project.
     - Test Mode: The test mode is a simulation mode that you can use to test  your integration 
       flow. Your customers will not be able to make payments in this mode.
     - Navigate to Account & Settings ‚Üí API Keys (under Website and app settings) ‚Üí Generate Key 
       to generate key for the selected mode.
     - The ‚ÄúKey Id‚Äù and ‚ÄúKey Secret‚Äù appear on a pop-up page. you can set them up in your .env 
       file as described earlier.
       RAZORPAY_KEY = ‚Äúyour_razorpay_key‚Äù
       RAZORPAY_SECRET = ‚Äúyour_razorpay_secret‚Äù
